# Password Cracker

## Description

This Python script is a basic password cracker that attempts to crack hashed passwords using a list of potential passwords (wordlist) and various hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256). It defines a HashCracker class and provides functionality to read hashed passwords, read a wordlist of potential passwords, and attempt to crack the passwords.

## Features

- Supports MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 hashing algorithms.
- Ability to read hashed passwords from a file.
- Ability to read a wordlist of potential passwords.
- Attempts to crack passwords and saves the cracked passwords to a file.

## Usage

1. **Requirements:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository:** 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-cracker.git
   cd password-cracker
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   ```sh
   python password_cracker.py
   ```

4. **Follow the Prompts:** The script will prompt you to provide the path to the hash file, wordlist, and the file to save cracked passwords.

5. **Results:** If any passwords are successfully cracked, they will be saved in the specified file. The script will indicate when the cracking attempt is completed.

## Customization

- You can customize the script by adding more hashing algorithms or additional features to enhance its capabilities.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

- **Please use this tool responsibly and ethically.**
- Password cracking should only be performed for legitimate and authorized purposes, such as security testing or recovery of forgotten passwords.
- Unauthorized use of password cracking tools is illegal and unethical.
